# SoybeanPrototype
The beginning stages of developing and testing the plausibility of detecting color and size of soybean pods to estimate a future harvest date.

The Soybean prototype aims to detect and cut soybeans from an uploaded image using OpenCV. From there, the desire is that we can analyze the percent and range of RGB color values within the soybeans present. This information would be used to calculate and determine if there is a correlation between soybean color and future harvest date. This system could help K-State researchers and farmers alike.
